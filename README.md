# Allocation-of-resources-during-COVID-19
## The coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted almost every aspect of the business world â€“ the stock market has come crashing down, employees have been laid off at alarming rates, and consumers are unable to spend their money while in quarantine. Amid all of this panic, how can we ensure that essential workers (i.e. doctors, nurses, caregivers) have the essential equipment to keep themselves and others safe?
### One concern that has been actively expressed is that people in high-risk situations will not have access to respirators, masks, or even hospital beds. According to The _New York Times_, hospitals have been stretched thin, in terms of services it can provide for its patients. There is simply not enough room and not enough resources to continue. However, as we begin to utilize the national stockpile of essential equipment, and companies tirelessly produce makeshift respirators, we must target these resources towards the people who need it most.

## Why New York?
### As we can see from this graph, New York state has been hit the hardest out of all US states and territories. According to _Vox_, the reason there are so many cases in the state is because government officials did not act quickly enough in shutting down public spaces. Despite not taking the threat of COVID-19 seriously at the beginning, New Yorkers are now staying inside as the number of deaths continue to grow.

## How to allocate resources
### To solve the massive pandemic that is brutally attacking New York, we must send as many resources there as we can. Because the city is so densely populated, there will be high demand for things such as masks, respirators, as well as resources like unemployment financing. It is the federal government's responsibility to get the situation in New York under control first, because if it doesn't, a massive amount of people will either die or spread the virus to other states.
